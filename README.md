Sublime PowerShell

Adds support for PowerShell 4 syntax to Sublime Text. 

There are really only two differences in PowerShell 3 and 4 syntax although there are a few more for older versions.

NOTE: 
As of 2014-02-28 this package also includes a few helper commands for using Sublime in collaboration with ConEmu. 
We may separate those into a "ConEmu" package in the future.
